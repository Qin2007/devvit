# Future roadmap

Devvit Web is still very experimental, but in general we’re following these key principles:

- Make Devvit apps easier to build.
- Lean into open web technologies.
- Get to parity with what’s supported in Devvit today.

Here are a few things you have to look forward to:

**Streamlined configuration**: moving all configuration from devvit/main.tsx into a devvit.json file. In the future, your directory might look like this:

```tsx
-src -
  client / // where your webview code goes
    -server - // where your endpoints that your app talks to go
  devvit.json; // where you put your config file for devvit
```

**Fully supported Devvit capabilities**: here’s an example of what supported capabilities in the configuration file might look like:

```tsx
{
   "$schema": "https://developers.reddit.com/schema/v1/config.json",
   "name": "my-dope-app",
   "version": "1.2.3",
   "server": {
      "entrypoint": "dist/server/server.js",
   },
    /* ... capabilities like scheduler can be defined here */
    "scheduler": {
      "my-job": {
        "cron": "0 12 * * *",
        "endpoint": "/internal/jobs/my-job"
      },
/* ... other jobs & capabilities */
    },

  /* ...permisisons can be defined here */
   "permissions": {
       "reddit": true,
	"redis": true,
       "fetch": {
           "allowedDomains": [ "google.com" ]
      }
   },

}
```

**@devvit/client library**: a robust library to handle client side interactions–including toasts, forms, payments, and more–and context events for your client app to know when to instantiate and with the right data.

Other areas we’re exploring include:

**1st screen customization**: giving you different options for customizing your first screen per post.

**Marketing assets**: an area for developers to provide marketing assets (with required dimensions) to help promote your app.

```tsx
"assets": {
  "icon": "images/icons.png",
  "splashScreen": "images/splash.png",
  "screenshots": [
       "images/screenshot1.jpg",
       "images/screenshot2.jpg",
   ]
}
```

**Multi-post-support**: making it easier to handle routing through a top-level entry point.
