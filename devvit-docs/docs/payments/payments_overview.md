# Overview

Add products to your app and get paid for what you sell. The payments plugin lets you prompt users to buy premium features that you build into your app, like in-game items, additional lives, or exclusive features into your app.

## How to get paid

You’ll set the price of the products in your app in Reddit [gold](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/17331548463764-What-is-gold-and-how-do-I-use-it). Users will use gold to acquire the items, and an equivalent amount of gold will accumulate in your app account.

Information about payouts is located [here](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/30641905617428-Developer-Program#h_01J8GCHXEG24ZNR5EZZ9SPN48S).
