# Monetization

See how other developers add products and payments to [monetize](../payments/payments_overview.md) their apps.

## Buildit

[Buildit](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildit/) is a 2D platformer game developed by [5th Cell](https://www.5thcell.com/) exclusively for Reddit.

Redditors compete in challenges to earn a top spot on the leaderboard, unlock custom flair, and shitpost in the comments along the way. They can also build their own challenges to share with the community.

### How to play

Use your keyboard or the virtual buttons to move your Snoo. Try to reach the key as fast as possible, but watch out for traps!

You can also build a new level. Add tiles and objects to a custom map and throw down your challenge by posting it to the community.

### Adding payments

In-game purchasing is integrated into the “build” aspect of the game. There are a variety of free tiles available for redditors to use in the building process, or they can purchase special tile sets to customize their challenge. 5th Cell used the [monetization](../payments/payments_overview.md) feature to add premium items to their game.

### From the developer

_Although the primary focus of buildit was on competition, we also wanted to allow players to customize the tile sets behind the levels. This was a perfect fit for monetization using Reddit gold. Including the SDK was quick and easy, and offers a small but important customization element to the final game._

_It’s proven that adding optional purchases for core users can increase engagement and boost retention. We’re excited to see how players customize their levels in the future!_

## Dark Dungeon

[Dark Dungeon](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkDungeonGame/) is an experimental game developed by [Cabbage Systems](https://www.cabbagesystems.com/) exclusively for Reddit. Each [interactive post](interactive_posts.md) contains a trap-filled dungeon, and you need to find the exit if you want to survive.

### How to play

Click or tap to move your knight, and use the footsteps of past redditors to try to figure out an exit route. Along the way you’ll find much-needed food—and also the skulls of players who died in a trap and tombstones marking players who died of hunger.

### Adding payments

Players are rewarded with gems (in-game currency) for every dungeon they successfully escape. These gems can be used to purchase powerful boosts—like lock picks that open any door, gut expanders to extend the hunger limit, and brighter torches to illuminate their path. Using the [payments](../payments/payments_overview.md) feature, Cabbage Systems added the ability for players to also purchase in-game gems using Reddit Gold.

### From the developer

_Cabbage Systems is proud to be the first team to integrate the payments API into a game for Reddit. Implementation was very straightforward, and went off without a hitch._

_Our game wasn't designed from the beginning to include in-game purchases, so we were careful not to disrupt the game's original intention when adding the shop. By allowing Redditors to earn gems through gameplay or purchase them with Reddit Gold, we tried to leave room for Redditors who wanted to use Gold and those who didn't._

_Dark Dungeon is a single-player game with community features, so we wanted to stock the game's shop with items that might help players when they're stuck, or encourage players to find secrets to share with the community. We believe it's important in games that include any kind of multiplayer interaction to avoid perceptions of "pay to win," so we did our best to keep the game fair for everyone._
